# Instructions

## Print & play file instructions

The print&play file is `secret-hitler_pnp_print-a3.pdf`.

### File content

This file contains all the minimum necessary cards and material to play Secret Hitler from 5 to 10 player, including all the boards. There is an excess of 2 Ballot cards "Ja!" and "Nein" for each sheet.

### Printing instructions

The file has been prepared for A3 paper (420x297mm).

To print this file, just set the printer for double-sided printing, so that the sheets are reflected vertically. The last sheet of the file (page 17) doesn't need the back to be printed.

After printing, follow the crop marks to cut the cards and you're done. Have fun!

**N.B.: depending on the printer/paper, the front and back of the prints might not line up. If you cannot line them up, you can print just the front sheets. Another option is to print front and back, then cut the cards from the back side, so that when they are in a deck in a covered position, their content cannot be distinguished.**

## Single elements file

The file `secret-hitler_elements.pdf` contains all the single elements that compose the game, including their backs.


## Source files

In the folder `source-files` you can find all the files that have been used to create the print & play PDF.

In particular:
- the folder `secret-hitler-definitive-pnp-edition_print-a3` contains the source file that has been used to create the layout
- the folder `designs` you can find all the files with vectors and construction elements. There are both `.ai` files and `.eps`, and under `__font` all the fonts used. See the `DESIGN-INSTRUCTIONS.md` file if you want to have a look at them, or modify the original vector graphics.
