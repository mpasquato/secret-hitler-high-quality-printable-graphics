# Design Instructions

## Description

Here you can find all the files with vectors and construction elements. There are both `.ai` files and `.eps`, and under `__font` all the fonts used.

**.ai files have all their layers locked. Unlock them to edit the content.**

Using layers and artboard names can help you if you find yourself lost in a file. 

## Files instructions & info

Here you can see a list of how the files are organized

### illustrations_construction.ai

It contains the vector illustrations used in the game, including all the steps from the first draft to the expanded final form. Use artboard names as references. Elements for the construction of custom brushes are also included.

### game-elements_construction.ai

It contains all the cards and tables and their construction elements, and editable text.

### game-elements_final.ai

It contains the final form of all the cards and tables, with expanded text (not editable anymore).

To add editable text in this file, just copy the editable text from `game-elements_construction.ai` and paste it in the same position.

The coloring has been done...
1. in simple elements, just by filling shapes with the desired color
2. in more complex elements (which are the most, like the illustrated liberal/fascist/Hitler cards), the illustrations were filled with greys; then in the `colors` level, rectangular shapes have been created with a specific fill color and with the `color` blending method, so you can easily change the tint of each card very easily.

Also colors have been set as global colors, so you can change them all at once.

That's all the info you need to modify these vectors. Have fun!

### eps

Under this folder you can find all the `.ai` files simply exported as `.eps`.
