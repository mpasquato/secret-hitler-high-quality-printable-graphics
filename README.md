# Secret Hitler High Quality Printable Graphics

## Description

In this version of the game I recreated vector shapes, cards and added a back graphic to them.

The package includes source files with vectors that you can use to easily modify to create your own version and a printable PDF prepared for a3 print. The packaging includes also all the fonts used to easily access them.

To learn more about how to print the game or how this project is structured, see the `INSTRUCTIONS.md` file.
